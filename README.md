# Overview of Project

## Purpose
Stock data is analyzed using a macro to determine which stocks Steve's parents should invest in.
Steve wants to find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. Daily volume indicates how active a stock is traded. Annual return shows how effective the stock is as an investment. 
The macro will be activated by a button on the tab "All_Stocks_Analysis".
The user will be prompted to enter in the year he would like to perform the analysis on, and the tab will update accordingly.
The returns will be visually enhanced such that stocks with positive returns will be highlighted in green, and stocks with negative returns will be highlighted in red. 

## Background
